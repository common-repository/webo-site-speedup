== Installation ==

Here is [step-by-step How-to with screenshots](http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/wiki/InstallingWordPressPlugin "step-by-step How-to with screenshots") about WEBO Site SpeedUp for WordPress installation.

1. Upload `web.optimizer.wordpress.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Make folder `/wp-content/plugins/` writable for your web server.
1. Make sure that there is writable .htaccess in the website root, or website root is writable for your web server (only if Apache is used).
1. Activate the WEBO Site SpeedUp plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Go to WEBO Site SpeedUp and tune plugin settings in debug mode or activate WEBO Site SpeedUp.
1. Enjoy your fast website!

Please note that WEBO Site SpeedUp for WordPress requires WEBO Site SpeedUp core package. It will be downloaded automatically on plugin activation or else you will need to do it manually from [WEBO Site SpeedUp Storage](http://code.google.com/p/web-optimizator/downloads/list "WEBO Site SpeedUp Storage"), version 1.0.0+. For this:

1. Please select full archive (not Mini Installer), it's usually about 1 Mb in size, and its file name is webo.site.speedup.vX.X.X.zip (X is a number).
1. Download this package.
1. Unzip package inside `/wp-content/plugins/` directory. So you will have the following structure:
 - plugins
 - |__ web.optimizer.wordpress.php
 - |__ webo-site-speedup
 - . |__ cache
 - . |__ controller
 - . |__ ...

After creating such a structure please:

1. Make directories `webo-site-speedup/`, `webo-site-speedup/cache` and file `webo-site-speedup/config.webo.php` writable for your web server.
1. Deactivate GZIP in WordPress global settings. WEBO Site SpeedUp itself has better compression support.
1. Activate the WEBO Site SpeedUp plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

Also please deactivate (or delete) WEBO Site SpeedUp itself (if it's installed for your website).

Please clear cache in WP-Super-Cache, Hyper Cache, W3 Total Cache, or any other cache plugins to see result. Or just disable them - cache files are not affected. After applying all changes in WEBO Site SpeedUp configuration you can enable cache plugins back - HTML documents will be saved as optimized ones.

Please note that WEBO Site SpeedUp Premium Edition has also its own server side cache engine, which can be better than the mentioned above.
